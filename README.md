# 🚀 GitHub Scrapper by Impoflow

Welcome to the **GitHub Scrapper**, the ultimate tool for extracting real-world GitHub repositories and simulating user activity like a pro. Whether you're populating a dataset for analysis or building a Data Lake for testing purposes, this scrapper does the heavy lifting for you—efficiently, securely, and without cutting corners.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Scrape Repositories at Scale**: 
  Harvest data from GitHub like a boss. Configure it to pull projects, metadata, and more—perfect for testing, analytics, or just flexing your scrapping skills.
  
- **Dockerized for Portability**: 
  Spin it up anywhere with ease. Our Docker setup ensures consistency across environments, whether you’re working locally or deploying in the cloud.

- **Seamless S3 Integration**: 
  Automatically upload scraped repositories to your Amazon S3 Data Lake. Designed for scalability, this integration keeps your datasets centralized and ready for action.

- **Configurable and Flexible**: 
  Fine-tune parameters like repository types, search keywords, and scraping depth. Tailor it to your needs and extract only what matters.

## 📦 Installation

### Requirements:
